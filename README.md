# Current-Portfolio

I have been studying Web Development for about 3 months. My current portfolio showcases a few of the projects that I have worked on. They utilize Bootstrap, Javascript, and Firebase usage. The actual Current Portfolio has been created using Materialize. 

Tabs toggle information on my Education History, Work History, and Skills. 

The Cards showcase the Projects. When you click on the image, it gives a brief description. The links lead to the hosted Github sites. 

It is completely responsive.
